# stm32f411xx-spi-drivers

Udemy stm32 microcontroller course (MCU1) follow along code.

Code is not exact copy of whats shown in course but rather little bit tweaked version.

Code is tested on stm32f411CE, commonly called black pill.

NOTE: SPI code hasn't been tested yet because of unavailability of hardware (logic level converter).
